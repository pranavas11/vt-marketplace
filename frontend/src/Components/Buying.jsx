                            on Marketplace, simply select the “Only show free listings” filter. Many neighborhoods also have “Buy Nothing” groups where people give away

                                Ask a lot of questions before buying an item you’re interested in. Make sure you are able to see pictures that show all angles of the item, and get information
                                from the seller about an item’s history, authenticity and current condition. Thoroughly inspect the item before buying and test it if possible.
